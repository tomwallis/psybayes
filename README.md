psybayes
========

An R package for modelling psychophysical data using MCMC.

psybayes is a package to facilitate the fitting of data from psychophysical experiments in a Bayesian framework.
Models are fit using MCMC sampling conducted through Stan (and the rstan package). 
These will need to be properly installed on your system first (see \url{http://www.mc-stan.org} for setup).
Many of these functions are wrappers for rstan calls, or plotting functions that are commonly used.
