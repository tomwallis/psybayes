#' @description
#' psybayes is a package to facilitate the fitting of data from psychophysical experiments in a Bayesian framework.
#' Models are fit using MCMC sampling conducted through Stan (and the rstan package). 
#' These will need to be properly installed on your system first (see \url{http://www.mc-stan.org} for setup).
#' Many of these functions are wrappers for rstan calls, or plotting functions that are commonly used.

#' @author includes some code written by John Kruschke for the book Doing Bayesian Data Analysis.
