Description: psybayes is a package to facilitate the fitting of data from
    psychophysical experiments in a Bayesian framework.Models are fit using
    MCMC sampling conducted through Stan (and the rstan package). These will
    need to be properly installed on your system first (see
    \url{http://www.mc-stan.org} for setup). Many of these functions are
    wrappers for rstan calls, or plotting functions that are commonly used.
